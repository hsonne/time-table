## Import timetables from Untis 2025

In this repository, I provide some R scripts that allow to read class schedules from PDF files as they have been exported from ["Untis 2025"](https://www.untis.at/en/products/untis-timetabe-scheduling). 
Untis is a software that is used by schools to create timetables.

Two types of timetables can be read so far:
1. Class view timetables
2. Teacher view timetables
